# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This repository contains all the code for my personal website where I showcase my skills, projects, and ways to connect with me.

## How to View the Website

To view the website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
4. Alternatively, if you have Visual Studio Code installed, you can use the `Go Live` feature to view the website. Open the project in VS Code, click on the `Go Live` button at the bottom of the window, and the website will open in your default browser.
